	<h2> A list of galaxies!</h1>
		<p> Here we will provide you a list of galaxies, it's awfully short. It's awfully short because we don't really know any galaxy names except the obvious ones. We also include an additional name, which to the of our knowledge, is not the name of a galaxy in the known universe. However, we have strong reason to believe that this is indeed the name of a colony in a parallel universe where you grow up to be the princess of Camelot. </p>
