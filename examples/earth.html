Monkeys make me a little nervous. </p><p class=highlight>They are too smart for their own good. </p><p>They are like scary toddlers with sharp teeth. Nobody needs that up close. Nobody. Just swing in the faraway trees you lot. </p></article></li>

		<p id=addendum>At some point I will add details of these sections on this page so you can click on them and navigate to that part of the page using id elements(fragment identifiers. These are popular in Single Page Applications (SPA) the boring websites that hop up and down instead of having multiple pages. </p>
